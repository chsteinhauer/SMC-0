# SMC-0 Project



## Companies and products

* **Brüel & Kjær:** A lot of specialized software in acoustic analysis.

* **Izotope:** Ozone

* **Oeksound:** soothe2

* **Bose:** Bose Frames


### Chosen product

**Soothe2:** A VST plugin that removes resonance and harshness from soundsources in realtime and makes the mixing process easier for music producers in the final stages of their workflow.

## Problem

It is an enervating process for a music producer to ensure that their track sounds good in all sound systems and contexts, and lives up to a certain standard of commercialized music in the music industry.


### Problem description:

* How can we create a VST plugin that detects resonant frequencies and removes them in realtime, ensuring better audio quality on sound systems and lives up to a certain standard of commercialized music in the music industry? 

<!--* Make music sound good
* How can we implement a tool to make the mastering process easier for music producers in the final stages of their workflow-->

### Pains



## Requirements

* Make it commercilizable
* Make it more simple
* 

## Proposed iterations and evaluations

## Milestones

## Hack the product (reverse engineer)


## Project timeline

### 2. september 2022

* We brainstormed some companies with products that could be interesting to look into. Our first choice was Ozone from the company Izotope.
* First draft of problem description is formulized.

### 5. september 2022

* We changed our product to **soothe2** by Oeksound, as we concluded that Ozone was too complex regarding all its features that are outside our scope. **soothe2** attempts to solve the same problem, but is much simpler in its approach, and only focus on the refinement of ressonance in the mastering process.
